# magnetosphere-modeling-research
Developed an improved computational model of auroral arcs in the plasmasheet region of the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere. Used magnetospheric physics, numerical methods (e.g. difference equations), and Mathematica to construct a step-up model of plasmasheet field lines. Paper provided in the repo. Full code upon request--not provided here due to length and complexity. The Mathematica notebook provided allows one to plot the field lines from case 2B within the paper. To plot the field lines, open and run the notebook.
